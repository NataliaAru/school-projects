# My First CAD

This module is a _very_ simple CAD (drawing) program using a Model-View-Controller architecture, created for the [Software Architecture](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1186629) course at the UW iSchool.
##Note: not all files are avalible since this is just to showcase my use of Model-View-Controller understanding
