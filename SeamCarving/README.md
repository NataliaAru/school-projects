# SeamCarving
Seam-carving is a content-aware image resizing technique where the image is reduced in size by one pixel of height (or width) at a time.
Even though the implementation of this technique is straight forward and does not use complicated algoritms, but this is a great example
of how basics can be used to solve what at first site looks like a commpicated real life problem.
