# Percolation
Project involved applying understanding of QuickUnionFind algorithm to calculate perculation of the system. 
#### Percolation.
Scientists have defined an abstract process known as percolation to model situations as porous landscape with water
on the surface, under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom.
